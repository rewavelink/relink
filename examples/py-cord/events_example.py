# This example requires the py-cord[voice] (https://pypi.org/project/py-cord/) library to be installed.

# This example covers the procedure of creating a simple music bot using sonolink,
# with event handlers for track lifecycle and node events.
#
# This requires an active Lavalink server, for more information on setting up one
# you can check the guide at: https://sonolink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/lavalink-setup.html
